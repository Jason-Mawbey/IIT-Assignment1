<h3>Picture:</h3> <img src="Jason for assignment 1.jpg" width="100%">
<h3>Nationality:</h3><p>Australian</p>
<h3>Culture:</h3><p>Australia Is an isolated continent surrounded by water on all sides. The native Aboriginal people lived isolated from other cultures for around 40,000 years before New South Wales was colonised by the British (Roe n.d.). Because of their cultural and societal progress Australians are proud of their heritage and have an aversion to flamboyant and self-important people (Roe n.d.). </p>
<h3>Education to date:</h3> <p>High school year twelve was completed in 2011, I immediately commenced my Diploma of Nursing then expanded my knowledge by completing my Batchelor of Nursing.
To maintain my continued professional development (CPD) for nursing, I am required to complete twenty hours of professional development every year to maintain my Batchelor of Nursing.</p>
<h3>Languages spoken:</h3><p>EEnglish is the primary language spoken by myself and extended family.</p>
<h3>My hobbies:</h3> <p>My hobbies include archery, reading and occasionally playing computer games. I always set some time aside every day to read a book chapter or catch up on world news. My favourite book genres are history, with a special interest in World War II. Fiction authors I enjoy include Suzanne Collins and Antony Beevor.</p>
<h3>Interest in IT:</h3><p>Ever since I was young, I was interested in information technology (IT). Seeing the world change as new technology became more accessible to the public and the creative and innovative ways people utilised it. Many facets of society now use IT that is easily observable  for example, farming irrigation to business operations in sales.
My interest was sparked when my parents went racing out the door to get a 1GB Universal Serial Bus (USB) that was on sale. At the time I only saw a computer you use for homework and the PS1. Seeing my parents spent $100 on a USB back in the 1990’s raised lots of questions including: what is a USB and why not use a floppy disk? What does it stand for? What is a gigabyte?
These questions lead me to be more aware of technology in my environment that is being used and the rapid progression of technological innovation in mainstream society.
I have no working experience in IT and don’t know how to program in any language, hence my enrolment. To remedy this lack of knowledge I wanted to learn from a reputable education source. I chose RMIT because this course was accessible online, allowing me to study whilst continuing to work full time.
In my studies I hope to learn skills to be able to successfully design, implement, support and maintain applications and networks. I also hope to gain skills to look at system designs to identify weaknesses and limitations then implement changes for a faster, smoother service.</p>
