<h3>Nationality:</h3><p>Australian</p>
<h3>Culture:</h3><p>Australia Is an isolated continent surrounded by water on all sides. The native aborigional people lived isolated from other cultures for around 40,000 years before New South Wales was settled by the British (Roe n.d.).</p>
<p>Australia was settled as a penal colony and was perceived as a harsh and inhospitable land. Because of their cultural and societal progress Australians are proud of their heritage and have an aversion to flamboyant and self-important people (Roe n.d.). </p>
<h3>Education to date:</h3> <p>High School year 12 was completed in 2011, I immediately commenced my Diploma of nursing then expanded my knowledge by commencing my Batchelor of nursing.
To maintain my CPD I have completed 20 hours of professional development every year since completing my diploma of nursing.</p>
<h3>Languages spoken:</h3><p>English is the only language myself and my family speak.</p>
<h3>My hobbies:</h3> <p>My hobbies include archery, reading and occasionally playing computer games. I always set some time aside every day to read a book chapter or short story. My favourite book genres are History, fiction and non-fiction.</p>
<h3>Interest in IT:</h3><p>Ever since I was young, I was interested in IT. Seeing the world change as new technology became more accessible to the general public and the creative and innovative ways people utilised it.
My interest was sparked when my parents went racing out the door to get a 1GB USB that was on sale. At the time I only saw appliances as a computer you use for homework and the PS1. Seeing my parents spent $100 on a USB raised lots of questions including: what is a USB and why not use a floppy disk? What does it stand for? What is a gigabyte?
These questions lead me to be more aware of technology in my environment that is being used and the rapid progression of technological innovation in mainstream society.
I have no working experience in IT and don’t know how to program in any language… yet. To remedy this lack of knowledge I wanted to learn from a reputable education source. I chose RMIT because this course was accessible online, allowing me to study & work full time.
In my studies I expect to learn the skills to be able to successfully design, implement, support and maintain applications and networks. I also expect to gain the skills to look at system designs to identify weaknesses and limitations then remedy them.</p>
