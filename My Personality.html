<h3>What the test results mean to me</h3>
<p>These test results show that I am an agreeable person putting the needs of others before my own (TRUITY n.d.). The low extroversion score is very understandable for me. I dislike putting any personal information about myself out into the open and prefer to talk to people face to face (TRUITY n.d.). It also explains why I would not have a Facebook profile if it didn’t help when looking for jobs. (TRUITY n.d.).</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
<p>While I work with others, I have a low extroversion scores meaning that I don’t seek to socialise and find it mentally draining to talk to people about random topics. (TRUITY n.d.). I am a visual learner and prioritise to learn new information and make conclusions based of logical deductions based on the knowledge I have acquired (NERIS Analytics Limited n.d.). While these scores talk about my personality I will have to be mindful of the weaknesses and work on my ability to articulate my thoughts and ideas to building upon my strengths (TRUITY n.d.).</p>

<h3>How should you take the test results into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>The sixteen personality and the big five personality test may identify me as an introvert this means that I have to be conscious to ensure there is a method of communication for all of my team members. These results show that I can work in a calm and logical manor independently (NERIS Analytics Limited n.d.).
My learning style is mostly a visual learner but as this test shows I am not only a visual learner I am a tactile and auditory learner (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency n.d.).
That being stated personally I believe that work in a group can create results greater than the independent effort of just one person. A team effort brings everyone’s strengths together to cover key areas to address. When forming a team, you should allocate people into different roles that promotes their strengths to optimise outcome (Suner 2020).</p>
