<h1>COSC2196: Introduction to Information Technology Assessment 1: My Profile</h1>

<h1>Project idea:</h1>

<h3>Project overview</h3>
<p>My project proposition is to use an Arduino to program a Christmas light display. This display will have various patterns coded into the Arduino that will output the program to interact with LED Lights to create various patterns and help decorate the house this Christmas.
This project will have a minimum of 3 different patterns including solid lights, strobing and flashing.  This project will also have it programmed to remember the date and turn to a neutral colour so you can use it to illuminate wherever you put it. The advantage to this project is that once the Arduino controlled lights have been created you can set and forget or continue to create codes to alter the pattern and can also be programmed to respond to external stimulus (E.g., motion sensor, button press, Date ect).
</p>

<h3>Motivation for proposition</h3>
<p>Australia is a multicultural society that celebrates multiple religions and holidays. One of the holidays I observe is Christmas. It is my family’s Christmas tradition to decorate our home with Christmas lights on the first of December every year so parents with young kids in the community can go for a walk and observe the Christmas lights (Sightseeing Tours Australia n.d.).
My motivation is to make something fun that provides an excellent educational experience for people taking their first steps into Information technology.
According to waveform lighting a normal four hundred and fifty lumen lightbulb uses forty watts while one foot of LED strip lights uses 4 watts and produces the same amount of lumens. That’s 0.125 watts per LED on average saving money on your Christmas decorations (Waveform lighting 2017).
</p>

<h3>Project Discription</h3>
<p>Initially I wasn’t planning to put forth this project idea but when I thought of this as an educational exercise this idea started sounding better and better (Hammond n.d.).
Having lights programmed using an Arduino is not a new idea there is lots of tutorials of how use the Arduino for a variety of DIY projects. There are lots of easy to find projects where people have created a system that is programmed to move to a song on the internet, but I have not seen any that combines the light to a RTC or light sensor (Hammond n.d.).
The RGP Christmas lights will be made using an Arduino board to program patterns into RGB LED lights that can be placed indoors or outdoors and provide lighting throughout the year or stored for a later date.  The Arduino will remember the date using a Real Time Clock (RTC) module and change the colour & light pattern based off the date. A light sensor so we can program the lights to only activate when it is dark and turn off automatically at sunrise or a predetermined programmed time.
This project will be educational for all team members who participate in this project by utilising skills such as coding in a computer language similar to C and C++ (Circuito Team 2018). Interpersonal communication, Reading electrical schematics, and gain skills and experience that can be translated directly into the workforce including Teamwork, punctuality, attention to detail and problem solving (Indeed Editorial Team 2021).
The team members will program a system with internal and external inputs working together to activate a multi coloured structured light display.
There are several foreseen issues things that needs to be addressed including the cost of the project.
If this project is successful, it will be expensive. In my opinion It would be better to create a mock up using a bread board to show as a proof of concept prior to committing to a full-scale creation.
Any electrical work that is not done by a licenced electrician can potentially cause fires or injury (Energy safe Victoria n.d.).
To help mitigate the risk of injury or damage when testing the product, it we must perform initial testing in a safe environment without any flammable materials and follow the work safe electrical safety guidelines (WorkSafe Victoria 2019).
All the power components must be packaged in a weather resistant container of at least IP65 – IP69 (RS Components n.d.).
This makes my idea decorative and able to be used for utility/safety for the rest of the year.
</p>

<h3>Tools and technology required</h3>
<p>This creation of these lights will require Arduino IDE program is a free opensource software developed to assist the creation of and upload of a program to a Arduino (Arduino n.d.). Other hardware required that I have identified is:
Arduino Board (Arduino 2022).
RGB LED Light strip (Waveform lighting 2017).
Power adapter to help stepdown power to not burn out the 5 volt Arduino but still power the 12volt LED lights (Arduino n.d.).
LED Resister (Edman 2012).
RTC Module. A real time clock module measures time and can be powered by an internal battery (MisterBotBreak 2019).
Power supply (Hammond n.d.).
Electrician guidance (Energy safe Victoria n.d.)
Light sensor (Arduino get started 2021).
Heat Shrink tubing (Hammond n.d.).
Heat Gun (Hammond n.d.).
</p>

<h3>Skills Required to complete this project</h3>
<p>This project will require an electrician’s guidance or a pre-made electrical plan to follow to help with the design and power management (Energy safe Victoria n.d.).
I already see issues transforming different voltages for the Arduino and LED lights (12v per meter). The Arduino if used too long at 12v is likely to burn out (Arduino n.d.).
We will require a soldering iron to connect all of the circuitry together.
The person assembling tis project will require access and the skill to use a soldering iron to connect the circuitry together (Hammond n.d.).
</p>

<h3>Expected project outcome</h3>
<p>If this project is successful, we will have lights that have being programmed to turn on and off based on the current outside lighting, time and date. In my opinion This project has lots of potential for further development. We could also at a later date program different colour patterns for different holidays. These decorations will also help illuminate the area we decide to place the decorations for every other day of the year.</p>
