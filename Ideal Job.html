<h1>COSC2196: Introduction to Information Technology Assessment 1: My Profile</h1>

<h2>Ideal Job:</h2>
<p>My ideal job is becoming a systems administrator because it is a job that I can enter after completing a Batchelor of Information technology and immediately enter the workforce. I am also very interested in how systems and individual components work and are put together (SEEK n.d.).</p>

<h3>What the test results mean to me</h3>
<p>These test results show that I am an agreeable person putting the needs of others before my own (TRUITY n.d.). The low extroversion score is very understandable for me. I dislike putting any personal information about myself out into the open and prefer to talk to people face to face (TRUITY n.d.). It also explains why I would not have a face book profile if it didn’t help when looking for jobs. (TRUITY n.d.).</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
<p>While I work for others, I have low extroversion scores meaning that I don’t seek to socialise and find it mentally draining to talk to people (TRUITY n.d.). I am a visual learner and prioritise to learn new information and make conclusions based of logical deductions based on the knowledge I have acquired (NERIS Analytics Limited n.d.). While these scores talk about my personality I will have to be aware of the weaknesses and work to shore them up while also building upon my strengths (TRUITY n.d.).</p>

<h3>How should you take the test results into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>The 16 personality and the big five personality test may identify me as an introvert this means that I have to be conscious to ensure there Is an method of communication for all of my team members. These results show that I can work in a calm and logical manor independently (NERIS Analytics Limited n.d.).

My learning style is mostly a visual learner but as this test shows I am not only a visual learner I am a tactile and auditory learner (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency n.d.).


That being stated personally I believe that that work in a group can create results greater than the independent effort of just one person due to a team bringing everyone’s strengths together to cover out weaknesses. When forming a team, you should dedicate people into different roles that promotes their strengths (Suner 2020).
