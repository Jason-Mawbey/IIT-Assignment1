The minimum education requirements for this role is a certificate 4 in Information Technology.  Other workplaces may require a Diploma of Information Technology or a Batchelor of Information Technology (SEEK n.d.).
Advanced training to specialise in network and server administration is looked upon favourably by the potential employer (SEEK n.d.).
Some roles may require a current Police Check because you will have access to sensitive information (Riddles Staffing Pty Ltd 2022).
The role I posted as my ideal job requires a current Working With Children Check because you will be in contact with minors at the workplace (Riddles Staffing Pty Ltd 2022).
To maintain my Batchelor of Information Technology for this job I would have to maintain my CPD (SEEK n.d.).</p>
<h3>My Current Skills</h3> <p>I currently have a valid Police Check and Working with Children’s Check issued in Victoria. The Police Check was obtained through Fit to Work website and the Working With Children Check was obtained by completing the relevant documentation at a local Australia Post and submitting documents to the address supplied.
The Batchelor of Information Technology I am currently in the process of obtaining through RMIT Open Universities commencing 2022.
The ability to communicate and work as a team is a skill that has been developed through my current career as a nurse. This will continue to develop more by collaborating with other students on team projects.

<h3>What the test results mean to me</h3>
<p>These test results show that I am an agreeable person putting the needs of others before my own (TRUITY n.d.). The low extroversion score is very understandable for me. I dislike putting any personal information about myself out into the open and prefer to talk to people face to face (TRUITY n.d.). It also explains why I would not have a Facebook profile if it didn’t help when looking for jobs. (TRUITY n.d.).</p>

<h3>How do you think these results may influence my behaviour in a team?</h3>
<p>While I work with others, I have a low extroversion scores meaning that I don’t seek to socialise and find it mentally draining to talk to people about random topics. (TRUITY n.d.). I am a visual learner and prioritise to learn new information and make conclusions based of logical deductions based on the knowledge I have acquired (NERIS Analytics Limited n.d.). While these scores talk about my personality I will have to be mindful of the weaknesses and work on my ability to articulate my thoughts and ideas to building upon my strengths (TRUITY n.d.).</p>

<h3>How should you take the test results into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>The sixteen personality and the big five personality test may identify me as an introvert this means that I have to be conscious to ensure there is a method of communication for all of my team members. These results show that I can work in a calm and logical manor independently (NERIS Analytics Limited n.d.).
My learning style is mostly a visual learner but as this test shows I am not only a visual learner I am a tactile and auditory learner (Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency n.d.).
That being stated personally I believe that work in a group can create results greater than the independent effort of just one person. A team effort brings everyone’s strengths together to cover key areas to address. When forming a team, you should allocate people into different roles that promotes their strengths to optimise outcome (Suner 2020).</p>
